Quake Report App (Ongoing Project)
===================================

This is my implementation of an application which displays a list of recent earthquakes in the world
from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) organization. The starter code with the Main Activity UI were provided by Udacity with the license http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
All the code after that has been added by me and uses the same copyright license.
